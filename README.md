# Shoot The Breeze

In this project we set out to build a chat-box style app in which users could shoot the breeze with each other from a sign-in with google accounts on Firebase. Within each users account, upon sign-in, they are able to save up to 100 messages and view a list of users that are present in the chat room. Users are also able to filter through messages by message content, username, and date/time. They can sort messages by new or old, and can also sort messages by clicking a user that is present on the user-list.
